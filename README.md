# Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this project is to provide insightful weather data, specifically for June and December, to determine the sustainability and profitability of a year-round Surf and Ice Cream shop in Oahu, Hawaii.  For this analysis, we used weather trends from 2010 to 2017.

### Resources applied
To develop this analysis the following resources were applied:

- Platform: Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, VSC, Python, Numpy, Pandas, and SQLite
- File with the weather data: Hawaii.SQLite – to access the data, please click [here](https://github.com/Marietas/surfs_up/blob/main/SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb)

# Results

We used Python to develop the [code](https://github.com/Marietas/surfs_up/blob/main/SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb) to analyze and evaluate the temperature trends in Oahu for June and December. The data includes 1700 records for June 1517 for December. 

Throughout this analysis, we could observe the following information for both months: **Maximum** and **Minimum** temperatures and the **Average value** and the **Standard Deviation** for the same period.

Overall, the results show that the temperature’s average is around 75F  for June, while in December, it is 71F deg. 

The standard deviation calculated for December is slightly higher than  June, which reveals that the temperatures in December are not as stable as the ones in June.

Moreover, we can notice that the temperatures (maximum and Minimum) in June are higher than in December. 

# Summary

The data obtained shows that temperatures in  December tend to be a little lower than those in June.  At first glance, this slight difference indicates that it could be a favorable decision to invest in an Ice-cream and Surf shop business in this specific location.

However, to support this decision, we have added precipitation data to the analysis. Data includes records for June and December from 2010 to 2017. 

Precipitation data are shown below

From this analysis, we can highlight the following points:

- December tends to present days with heavy rainfall.  The max value measured in a single day for this month is 6.42 versus 4.43 in a day measured in June.
- The precipitation average in June is 0.136 per day, while in December, this number reaches 0.217.
- The data show that there is no rainfall over 25% of both moths. 

After considering the results of the analysis for both the temperature and precipitation, we can conclude that weather conditions are favorable to open a sustainable year-round surf and ice cream shop in Oahu.
