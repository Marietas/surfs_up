# Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this project is to provide insightful weather data, specifically for June and December, to determine the sustainability and profitability of a year-round Surf and Ice Cream shop in Oahu, Hawaii.  For this analysis, I used weather trends from 2010 to 2017.

### Resources applied
To develop this analysis the following resources were applied:
- Platform: Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, VSC, Python, Numpy, Pandas, and SQLite
- File with the weather data: Hawaii.SQLite – to access the data, please click here

# Results

I used Python to develop the code to analyze and evaluate the temperature trends in Oahu for June and December. The data includes 1700 records for June 1517 for December. 

Throughout this analysis, we could observe the following information for both months: **Maximum** and **Minimum** temperatures and the **Average value** and the **Standard Deviation** for the same period.

- Data Outlined for December

Fig December

Overall, the results show that the temperature’s average is around 75F  for June, while in December, it is 71F deg. 

The standard deviation calculated for December is slightly higher than  June, which reveals that the temperatures in December are not as stable as the ones in June.

Moreover, we can notice that the temperatures (maximum and Minimum) in June are higher than in December. 

# Summary

The data obtained shows that temperatures in  December tend to be lower than the ones in June. At first glance, this difference indicates that it could be a favorable decision to invest in an Ice-cream and Surf shop business in this specific location.

However, to support this decision, we have added precipitation data to the analysis. Data includes records for June and December from 2010 to 2017.
